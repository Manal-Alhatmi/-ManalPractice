Elara is a slender, sharp-eyed girl of fifteen with sun-kissed skin and a tangle of chestnut curls. Her curiosity often leads her into places others avoid, and sheâ€™s known in the village for her quiet bravery. It was her bold spirit that drew her to the map hidden beneath the floorboards.
Shadow, a sleek midnight-gray wolf with piercing amber eyes, has followed Elara since she rescued him as a pup. Silent and watchful, he moves like smoke through the trees, ever alert to danger. Fiercely loyal and intelligent, Shadow communicates through subtle gestures, always staying one step ahead to protect Elara.
