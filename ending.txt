Elara vanished beyond the last rune-marked tree, the map slipping from her fingers as the forest closed behind her. The village waited, candles lit each night for her return, but she never emerged. The woods grew darker, heavier, and the whispers turned to wails. What she unlocked could not be sealed again, and the Whispering Woods remained a place of sorrow, haunted by the footsteps of a girl who tried to save it.
