The map was old, etched on weather-worn parchment and discovered beneath a loose floorboard in the village blacksmith’s hut. Elen, a curious orphan of barely fifteen winters, had only meant to escape the summer heat when she stumbled upon it. The ink shimmered faintly, as though alive, and strange symbols writhed at the edges like vines in a dream. At the center, drawn in silver leaf, loomed the forest no villager dared name aloud—the Whispering Woods. Elen’s fingers trembled. The stories spoke of voices in the trees, paths that moved, and a secret lost before time had a name.
Elara knelt beside the crackling hearth, the brittle map spread before her on the worn floorboards. Moonlight filtered through the window, casting silver veins across the parchment. Inked in deep emerald lines were winding trails, obscure symbols, and one unmistakable phrase: “The Heart of the Whispering Woods.” Her finger traced the route past Hollow Creek and over the Ridge of Echoes. Something about the symbols tugged at her memory—fragments of lullabies her grandmother once sang, warnings hidden in melody.

With a final glance around the cottage, Elara rose and pulled her cloak tight. She tucked the map into her satchel beside her compass and a flask of water. Doubt whispered at the edges of her resolve, but the pull of destiny—or perhaps something older—silenced it. She stepped outside into the cold hush of night, the scent of moss and pine sharp in the air. Without looking back, she set off toward the woods, where the wind spoke in forgotten tongues.
