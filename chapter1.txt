The map was old, etched on weather-worn parchment and discovered beneath a loose floorboard in the village blacksmith’s hut. Elen, a curious orphan of barely fifteen winters, had only meant to escape the summer heat when she stumbled upon it. The ink shimmered faintly, as though alive, and strange symbols writhed at the edges like vines in a dream. At the center, drawn in silver leaf, loomed the forest no villager dared name aloud—the Whispering Woods. Elen’s fingers trembled. The stories spoke of voices in the trees, paths that moved, and a secret lost before time had a name.
Elara hesitated at the forest’s edge, where the last shafts of sunlight met the gloom like a warning. The air inside the Whispering Woods was cooler, laced with the scent of damp earth and something older—like forgotten magic stirring beneath moss and bark. Each step she took onto the winding path was met with a hush, as if the forest were holding its breath. Shadows clung to twisted roots, and branches above whispered secrets in a tongue she almost thought she understood. Though her heart pounded with doubt, something deeper—curiosity or destiny—urged her forward.
